# Lent-2019
Giving up not knowing JS as well as I should for Lent this year!

I had a video chat "debugging with a student" interview today for the lead instructor position at Flatiron School, and it was HARD. Props to all the coding school instructors out there - y'all really earn your $$ answering questions on the spot like that! Nerve-wracking.

The thing is - the video technical interview didn't go as well as I would have liked...but I think I could be REALLY GOOD at this type of job. I would LOVE to help people learning to code make it through a coding boot camp and achieve a career change or whatever their coding goals are. So, I am committing to getting better at JavaScript. Long term goal would be to work at a coding boot camp or help others learning to code in some capacity.

See, I have lived in HTML Design and email development for the past few years. I have learned a lot and grown so much as a front-end/designer type, but I have forgotten a lot of JavaScript because I don't use it daily. Emails and JavaScript are bascially not compatible.

In addition, we are in the midst of a huge data migration project at work, and the platform we are moving to DOES allow JavaScript logic behind the scenes and then renders to the view the correct information based on the logic. Our clients (hotels and spas) have tons of dynamic content and guest information that changes based upon different booking types and qualifiers. I want to be able to write these logic statements, some of which are very complex, in vanilla JavaScript (all that the new platform allows) without having to ask for help, take forever, get frustrated, etc. 

Therefore, I am committed to improving. The time is NOW to get better at JavaScript. Huge thanks to freeCodeCamp, Women Who Code, Moms Can Code, Wes Bos, Traversy Media and all my coding buddies/inspirational unoffical role models on Twitter & Instagram. Also to coding boot camps - Coding Dojo (my alma mater), SMU, Dev Mountain, Flatiron School, General Assembly...keep on keepin' on. <3 <3 <3
